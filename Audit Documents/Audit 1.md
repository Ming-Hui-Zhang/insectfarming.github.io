## 1. Relevant Stakeholders

### 1.1. Project Team 

Our project team consists of 4 undergraduate engineering students. All the members need to follow the ground rules in the team. Each member has their distinct roles and need to be responsible for their sections. Other external stakeholders can direct contact with the member if they have any advice, concerns or questions in one specific section.

### 1.2. Project Client

Our client is [Goterra Pty Ltd](https://www.goterra.com.au). The company is a organic waste management company. They believe that make a difference means doing things differently. Different with other organic waste processing technologies, Goterra farms insects, especially, Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia Illucens (BSF) to consume organic waste and Throughout the course of our process we harvest our larvae and frass to turn them into valuable agricultural commodities. The client team members are involved in this mobile insect processing plant design project are outlined in the table below.

  * Have capacity on the communication, such as email and appointment.

### 1.4. Shadow Team

The shadow team is another stakeholder in the project, who is enroled in the same tutorial slot as our project team. The shadow team has access to review all project information and will regularly provide feedback on each stages of project. Our project progress may inspired them and their recommendations may also be useful on the improvments of the project.

- Responsibilities of the project team to the shadow team
  * Provide shadow team the required access to our team project respoitories.
  * Communicate appropriately with shadow team.
